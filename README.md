# oled128x32-tm4c123g
This is an MDK project which is a driver for the 128x32 oled screens. 
Please remember to download and use TivaWare to use this code. 
Also, you will need to setup keil to use TivaWare as shown here -> http://www.ti.com/lit/ml/spmu355/spmu355.pdf
This code runs perfectly on TM4C123GH6PM. Still, use it at your own risk, especially on other launchpads.
